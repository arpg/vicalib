vicalib
=======

Vicalib is a calibration tool for visual or visual-inertial sensor systems. The system is able to calibrate camera intrinsics for pinhole, polynomial and r-theta camera models, as well as the camera-to-imu extrinsics, imu biases and scale factors for visual inertial system. Dependencies are as follows:

Dependencies
============
See the documentation at: https://github.com/arpg/Documentation/tree/master/Installation. Build all packages up to HAL, and then build this package.

Building
========
Make sure all dependencies are either built with CMake or installed (so that CMake can find relevant paths). Use CMake to generate makefiles and run make.

Usage
=====
Vicalib accepts images and IMU data passed via command line options with the following format 

vicalib [-models <cam_models>] [-cam <camera_uri>] [-imu <imu_uri] [-options]

-models defines the specific camera model to use for intrinsics calibration. These camera models are defined as follows:

  "fov": FOV camera model. suitable for wide angle (fish-eye) lenses [Straight lines have to be straight, F Devernay, O Faugeras, Machine Vision and Applications 13 (1), 14-24]
  
  "poly2": Polynomial camera model with two distortion parameters.
  
  "poly3": Polynomial camera model with three distortion parameters.
  "kb4": The Kannala Brandt camera model
  
  As an example, the following argument would signal that a stereo pair of FOV camera models should be calibrated:
  -model fov,fov
  
-cam specifies the URI for the camera information. The URI format is as follows

  -cam driver:[<driver_options>]//<driver_path>
  
  There are many camera drivers available in HAL (which is a dependency). The drivers are located in /Hal/Camera/Drivers. The specific usage for a library is provided in the <driver_name>Factory.cpp file. For example the FileReader driver is used to read images from disk. The FileReaderFactory.cpp file contains a list of <driver_options> available. A sample URI for the FileReader driver is as follows 
  
  file:[loop=1,startframe=100]///usr/local/datasets/my_dataset/[left,right]*pgm
  
  Which will attempt to read files with the [left,right]*pgm regex from the directory /usr/local/datasets/my_dataset/, skipping the first 100 frames and looping back to the first frame when reaching the end of the files.
  
  (Note that the FileReader driver has the capability to extract timestamps from file names, in order to sychronize visual and inertial information).
  
-imu specifies the URI for IMU information. It is formatted as follows

  -imu driver:[<driver_options>]//<driver_path>
  
  Similar to camer drivers, the IMU drivers are from the HAL library and are available from /HAL/IMU/Drivers. The specific usage can be found in the <driver_name>Factory.cpp file. For example the CsvDriver accepets a directory as the <driver_path> directory and expects the accel.txt, gyro.txt, mag.txt and timestamp.txt files in the given directory. These files must be CSV files containing the relevant sensor information as per CsvDriver.cpp.
  
  IMU data must follow the vision axis convention: X points to right, Y down, Z forward.
  
-options specifies a number of options to control the optimization. A description of these options can be obtained by running

  vicalib --help
  
  Note: If any of the boolean options have a default value of true, they can be turned off by prefixing them with "no" for example the -calibrate_imu flag has a default value of true. Passing -nocalibrate_imu turns this flag off.
  
  The description for a number of important options is as follows:
  
  -calibrate_imu: whether or not to including IMU information in the calibration. Will include by default the IMU to camera extrinsics, biases and scale factors
  
  -calibrate_intrinsics: calibrate the camera intrinsics as well as the extrinsics. (useful if calibrating a stereo rig with known intrinsics)
  
  -frame_skip: number of frames to skip before adding a measurement frame. (useful if there are too many frames in the dataset and you wish to skip some frames).
  
  -grid_preset: which grid preset to use. 0 indicates the small grid template, and 1 indicates the large template.
  
  -has_initial_guess: if a cameras.xml file already exists, whether to use the values within the file to initialize the optimization. Will speed up convergence as some initialization steps will be skipepd/.
  
  -num_vicalib_frames: Will begin the calibration after n frames. Useful if the dataset is too long and only a certain number of frames should be used.
  
  -use_only_when_static: only use frames where the IMU is not moving (thresholds set by -static_accel_threshold, -static_gyro_threshold and -static_threshold_preset).
  
  -find_time_offset: whether to optimize the time difference between the IMU and camera
  
  -use_system_time: whether or not to use the system_time or device_time timestamps. 
  
  Tips and Tricks
  ===============
  We have found the best way to get high quality visual-inertial calibrations is to calibrate the camera intrinsics separately from the camera-to-imu extrinsics. The quality of the extrinsic calibration is dependent on the quality of the intrinsic calibration. So it is beneficial to do intrinsics separately because this ensures we have the best possible foundation on which to build our extrinsic calibration. The process for this is as follows:

  First, take a calibration log for each camera's intrinsics separately using SensorViewer. Then run the intrinsic calibration in vicalib with the following command:

   - ./vicalib -grid_preset medium -remove_outliers=true -models <camera model> -cam log://<path to intrinsics calibration log file> -alsologtostderr

  Run the above command for each camera in your system individually. You may need to try this with several log files before you get a good intrinsics calibration. For our purposes a good calibration is one with RMS reprojection error of less than 0.04. Once you have obtained a good intrinsics calibration be sure to rename the resultant "cameras.xml" file because vicalib will overwrite cameras.xml the next time vicalib is run if it is not renamed. 

  Once you have a good intrinsics calibration for all of your cameras you can move on to the extrinsics calibration. As before, you want to take a calibration log using SensorViewer except this time you want to log all cameras and the IMU in a single log file. Once you have a log file you can run the extrinsic calibration in vicalib wtih the following command:

  - ./vicalib -grid_preset medium -remove_outliers=true -model_files <list of .xml files for each of your extrinsic calibrations (comma separated)> -calibrate_intrinsics=false -calibrate_imu=true -cam log://<path to extrinsics calibration log file> -imu log://<path to extrinsics calibration log file> -alsologtostderr

  In the above command we are telling vicalib that it should not try to calibrate the cameras' intrinsics because we're giving it a good intrinsic calibration for each camera in the -model_files flag. So vicalib will use our previous intrinsic calibrations, which we already know are good, and it will only calibrate the camera-to-imu extrinsics for each camera. As with the intrinsic calibration, you may have to try this several times before you get a good extrinsics calibration. For our purposes a good extrinsics calibration has an RMS reprojection error of 0.3 or less. 

  Getting a good extrinsics calibration will take more time though, because the extrinsics calibration takes much longer for vicalib to complete. Intrinsics usually takes less than a minute, but extrinsics can take more than ten minutes. Fortunately, there is a good way to tell if your extrinsics calibration will fail early in the process. The extrinsics calibration goes through three stages: intrinsics calibration, camera-to-imu rotation, and camera-to-imu translation. Even if we tell vicalib not to calibrate the intrinsics it will still run the intrinsics calibration as a check on the quality of the intrinsics calibrations we gave it in our model files. If you watch closely, vicalib will report the RMS reprojection errors for the intrinsics calibrations. This usually happens less than a minute into the calibration process. If any of the RMS reprojection errors for camera intrisics are greater than 0.1, your extrinsic calibration will probably not have good results. In this case it is best to abort the calibration, take another extrinsics calibration log, and try again.
